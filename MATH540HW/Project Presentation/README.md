# Overleaf UW Madison beamer template

Edit `main.tex`, and bibliographic entries to `main.bib` as needed.

The `latexmkrc` file is necessary to tell Overleaf where to find the
template, which is in the folder `uw-beamer-template`.

The `uw-beamer-template` was created by Tristan Ravitch in June 2009
and was modified by Jean-Luc Thiffeault.  See
